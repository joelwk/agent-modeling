      "Agent 2 key points:  The question of whether or not the term \"sandwich\" can be applied to something like an American style 'hot dog' is subjective in nature due largely because it depends on one’ s interpretation and understanding. A sandwich, by traditional definition refers broadly speaking - two pieces bread with some form filling between them; however this does vary culturally depending upon what constitutes a typical meal or snack within that culture e g an American hot dog could be considered as such in the US but not universaly so globablily.\n",
      "    The concept of 'hotdog' itself is largely cultural and can often have different meanings based on geographical location, for example it might include various types food items like sausages or other,  From a cultural and historical standpoint in America where it originated from as part of fast-food culture; yes indeed the term \"sandwich\" can be applied to something like what we know today commonly referred  simply known globally nowadays - an American style hotdog! This is because tradition dictates that bread encloses meat or other foodstuffs, and in this case it'd definitely qualify. However when considering global perspectives on the term \"sandwich\", where cultural normative definitions vary widely depending upon what constitutes a typical meal within each culture - then yes indeed an American hotdog could be considered as such universally but not vice versa because different cultures have their own interpretations of 'what' makes,  From both culinary definitions as well the etymological perspective of enclosing food items between two pieces'of a bready substance; yes indeed in America where it originated from and is part fast-food culture - an American style hotdog can be considered to fall under this category known globally nowadays.

The term \"sandwich\" itself is largely cult,   From a cultural and historical standpoint as well from the standardized definitions of 'what' constitutes to be classified under \"sandwich\", it is clear that an American style hotdog qualifies in this case due its nature - two pieces bread enclosing meat (or other fillings). However, when we consider global perspectives on what makes a sandwich and understand how different cultures interpret the term 'what' constitutes as such; then these views become more nuanced. Different regions have their own understanding of food items that can be classified under this category based upon one’s interpretation or geographical location - sausages, snacks etc., which might not qualify in other places due to differing cultural interpretations and normative,  The question of whether a hotdog qualifies as sandwich is indeed an interesting one that requires us to consider both the standardized definitions and cultural normative perspectives in order for it be fully understood from multiple angles - culinary or etymological definition standpoint versus regional interpretations based on geographical location.\n",
